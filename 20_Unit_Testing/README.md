In this Go program, we have:

Functions (Add, Subtract, Divide) to perform basic mathematical operations.

Unit tests (TestAdd, TestSubtract, TestDivide) for these functions. We test both valid and error cases for the Divide function.

A test setup and teardown using TestMain.

A table-driven test (TestTableDriven) to test multiple cases with different inputs and expected outcomes.

You can run these tests by executing go test in the directory where the program is located. This program demonstrates various unit testing techniques in Go.
