In this program:

## Use Case 1:
 Creating custom errors by implementing the error interface with a custom error type, CustomError.

## Use Case 2: 
Handling a division by zero error by checking for an error condition in the divide function and returning an error when necessary.

## Use Case 3:
 Handling a file not found error when attempting to open a file using the openFile function. It demonstrates how to use the os package to handle file-related errors.

## Use Case 4:
 Demonstrating error propagation by calling the divide function again, this time with valid inputs, and handling the error returned from it.
