## Use Case 1:
 A basic Goroutine is created to print a message concurrently.

## Use Case 2: 
 Multiple Goroutines are used for concurrent execution of tasks, demonstrating basic concurrency.

## Use Case 3: 
 Parallelism is achieved using Goroutines with multiple workers processing tasks in parallel.

## Use Case 4: 
 Channel synchronization is demonstrated to ensure one Goroutine waits for another to complete its work.

## Use Case 5:
 Parallel execution is achieved using a sync.WaitGroup, allowing multiple tasks to run in parallel.

## Use Case 6:
 Parallel execution is demonstrated again using a channel to signal task completion.

These use cases cover different scenarios for achieving concurrency and parallelism in Go, showcasing the power of Goroutines, channels, and synchronization mechanisms.
