## Use Case 1: 
We create and run multiple Goroutines using a sync.WaitGroup to wait for them to finish.

## Use Case 2: 
We demonstrate the basic use of channels for communication, with one Goroutine sending data to a channel and another receiving it.

## Use Case 3: 
We create a buffered channel, which allows multiple items to be buffered before they are read from the channel.

## Use Case 4: 
We use the select statement to perform a non-blocking receive operation on multiple channels and print the first available message.

## Use Case 5: 
We simulate error handling with channels, where one Goroutine sends an error to a channel, and another Goroutine uses a select statement to handle it with a timeout.

This program showcases various aspects of Goroutines and Channels in Go, including creation, communication, buffering, select statements, and error handling.
